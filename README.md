##About me

My name is Kayley :raising_hand:, I am a developer hailing from Ontario, Canada. When I'm not programming you can either find me on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/kayley87) streaming video games, hanging out with my corgi :dog: Sawyer, or consuming as many movies/tv shows as humanly possible. Last September I started a job programming in ColdFusion. I've learned a lot in the past year, and most importantly that I need to make sure I stay up to date with current technologies and hold myself accountable to create personal projects!
